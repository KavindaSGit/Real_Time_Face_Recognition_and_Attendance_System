**Real-Time Face Recognition and Attendance System** <br/><br/>
This project is a real-time face recognition and attendance system implemented in Python using OpenCV and the face_recognition library. It allows for automatic recognition of faces captured by a webcam feed and marks attendance for recognized individuals.
<br/><br/>

**Features:**

(1) Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV to capture video frames from a webcam and detects faces using the face_recognition library. <br/>
(2) Face Recognition: Recognizes faces by comparing them with a set of known faces' encodings. It uses pre-trained models to encode and compare faces. <br/>
(3) Attendance Marking: Automatically marks attendance in a CSV file for recognized faces along with the timestamp of their detection.<br/>
(4) Simple Interface: Provides a simple graphical interface to display the webcam feed with recognized faces and their corresponding names.<br/>

<br/>

**Acknowledgements:**
This project utilizes the following libraries:

(1) OpenCV: For image processing and video capture.<br/>
(2) face_recognition: For face detection and recognition.<br/>
(3) numpy: For numerical operations.<br/>
